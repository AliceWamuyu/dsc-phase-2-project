# House Data Analysis

Author: Alice Wanjiru Wamuyu

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the King county house sales dataset for Kings' real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and sell homes. I will use regression modelling in the Analysis.

### Business Problem

Kings' real estate agency helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes. There is a need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

### Data Understanding
For this analysis, I used the King county house sales dataset. This datasets contain information on the houses built between 1900 and 2015. My target variables are: Bedrooms,bathrooms,sqft_living,sqft_lot,floors,condition,grade,yr_built

### Methods
This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis and tregression modelling to find correlation between variables and coming up with a model for new data.

### Results
The living space has a positive correlation with the price of the house.

### Conclusions

The square footage of interior housing living space and the Grade of the house has a somewhat positive linear relationship. This means that an increase in the interior housing living space will lead to an increase in the price of the house similarily for the grade.

The MSEs for the train and test subsets are almost similar, which suggests that the model will perform similarly on different data
